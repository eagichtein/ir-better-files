JERUSALEM â Israelâs advanced Arrow 3 antiballistic missile system intercepted a target on Thursday in a region of space just outside the earthâs atmosphere in the first successful test of its kind, according to Defense Ministry officials.
The system, which is being jointly developed by the government-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and its subsidiaries and the American Boeing Company, is not yet operational.
But analysts described the interception as an important step in Israelâs effort to defend itself against the potential threat of ballistic missiles armed with nuclear and other nonconventional warheads from enemies like Iran.
Yair Ramati, the director of the Defense Ministryâs missile defense organization, said in a call with reporters about 90 minutes after the Arrow 3 interceptor missile was launched that the engagement of a ballistic missile target was âsuccessful and accurate.â
The test was conducted with the United States Missile Defense Agency from an Israeli test range. The target was launched somewhere above the Mediterranean Sea.
The Arrow 3 is intended to be the top tier of Israelâs multilayered air defense system, which has received substantial funding from the United States. The Iron Dome system intercepts less sophisticated, shorter-range rockets like those fired into Israel from Gaza, while another system, Davidâs Sling, which is expected to become operational soon, is meant to intercept midrange missiles.
The Arrow 2 system intercepts ballistic missiles higher up, but is slower than the Arrow 3, which can also maneuver in space, Israeli officials have said.
An Arrow 3 test interception was aborted about a year ago because of a problem with the target. The Arrow 2 has been successful in live-fire tests, but has not yet been used in a real field of battle.
âOne successful test still does not guarantee that the innovative system is already operational and can be deployed in battle conditions,â Ron Ben-Yishai, a military affairs analyst for Ynet, an Israeli news site, wrote on Thursday. âBut we, the citizens of Israel, can sleep a bit easier today than last night,â he added.
Mr. Ben-Yishai also contended that the international agreement reached this year with Iran to curb its nuclear program, a deal that was strongly denounced by Israelâs leaders, had given Israel a kind of timeout of a few years during which it could more fully develop its defenses.
