It is possible that North Korea will retrench and give their engineers time to fix the problems, maybe come back with a working missile in a year or two.
But if they were going to do that, they probably wouldn't have demanded those same engineers do six tests that were almost certain to fail, too rapidly to learn from the experience.
Possibly they will call this last flight a success and go home; possibly they will try a few more times in hopes of a better performance by dumb luck. But this path does not lead to an operational weapon, just a solitary propaganda stunt.
This should not be cause for complacency. Somewhere in North Korea is a group of people so desperate and foolish as to have launched six missiles that don't work. But somewhere else in North Korea are the people who carefully and methodically developed rockets that can put satellites into orbit, and nuclear weapons nearly as powerful as the one which flattened Hiroshima.
Anyone who can do these things, can build a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile if they take the time to do it right.

A new type of intermediate-range missile, the Pukguksong-2, was launched by North Korea on February 12.
It was their first launch since US President Donald Trump took office.

The North Koreans have shown us mock-ups of mobile ICBMs that they claim to be building, and rather than rushing into premature flight tests they have shown us pictures of a more cautious ground test program. They have also been working on a small ballistic-missile submarine, and a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile.
If these systems are in the hand of one of the careful, methodical, and competent North Korean engineering teams, they could emerge as more capable and versatile systems than the Musudan would have been -- but in that case, not until 2020 or later.
Today, all we have to worry about are the thousand or so short- and medium-range missile with which North Korea could attack targets in South Korea and Japan, and the dozen or so nuclear warheads they may be able to mount on some of those missiles.
