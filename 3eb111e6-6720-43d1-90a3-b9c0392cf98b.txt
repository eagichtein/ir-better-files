That new scenario towards dialogue and peace, led to a presidential summit with the South Korean president, Moon Jae In, last April 27 in the border village of Panmumjom, where they agreed to work for denuclearization and peace.
North Korea unilaterally suspended the talks scheduled for yesterday, in that same place, which would follow up on the agreements reached between the two rulers, because of what he called 'imprudent' military exercises.
He also ruled out holding the summit between Presidents Kim and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, if he intends to impose a unilateral nuclear resignation.
In this regard, Pyongyang made the decisive decision to extend the high-level North-South talks for an indefinite period until the South Korean authorities take a responsible action, emphasized Ri Son Gwon.
He assured that until the serious circumstance that caused the cancellation of the high-level North-South talks is repaired, the re-encounter with the current South Korean 'power' will not be easily achieved.
