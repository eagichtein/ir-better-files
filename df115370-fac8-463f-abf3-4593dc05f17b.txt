Washington (CNN)
Donald Trump shook up America. Now it's the world's turn.
The President-elect's decision to flout 40 years of diplomatic convention and take a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen last week suggested he may be just as disrespectful of protocol on the world stage as at home.
The call produced days of speculation about how the President-elect's impulsive style will reverberate around the globe and whether it could threaten the architecture of international relations.
There are many global traditions and arrangements that he could target, though each could carry a geopolitical or diplomatic price -- one reason even presidents who have come into office with all guns blazing often find that there's a reason why some taboos last so long.
Here are some of the conventions Trump could shake up once he becomes president next month.

Talking to North Korea's Kim Jong Un
Even Obama, who was willing to engage historic US enemies like Iran and Cuba, has balked at speaking to North Korea's unpredictable leader, Kim Jong-un. The George W. Bush administration also snubbed Kim's equally volatile father and predecessor, the late Kim Jong Il. President Bill Clinton did mull a visit to North Korea late in his second term, but eventually decided not to go.
There have been direct contacts with Pyongyang through a channel at UN meetings between officials from the two sides in Beijing, and post-presidential missions to the Stalinist state by Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

But the idea of direct, presidential-level engagement with the leader of North Korea, who rules with an iron fist, has been taboo. One reason is that such talks would be seen as a reward for threats and behavior apparently designed to win concessions from Washington.
But with North Korea making swift advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and threatening to precipitate the first international crisis of the Trump administration, could that change?
When asked by Reuters in May if he was ready to talk to Kim, Trump replied: "I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him."
Again, it's easy to make such remarks on the campaign trail. A conversation would risk squandering presidential prestige unless it came with a high diplomatic deliverable, so Trump might balk. Still, given the President-elect's unpredictability and faith in his own skills as a deal-maker, it would be unwise to rule out contact with Kim just yet.
Moving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem
Trump, like his predecessors Clinton and Bush, has voiced support for moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It's an easy vow for a candidate to make, especially since the issue is hugely important to the critical bloc of evangelical voters.
But it's one of those campaign vows that looks a lot less attractive viewed from the Oval Office.
The embassy is situated in Tel Aviv because the international community has not recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Furthermore, the Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, so moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would be extremely sensitive and seen by Arab states -- key to other US goals in the region -- as a sign that Washington is pre-judging final status peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
Though Congress has passed legislation mandating the move, these complications prompted Presidents Clinton, Bush and Barack Obama every six months to employ the law's waiver provision to put off the move on national security grounds.
But it's not clear that Trump will take the same stance.
"We will move the American Embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem," Trump said at the annual meeting of the America Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington in March.
Still, once he is embarked upon a presidency that will beset by global challenges, Trump may decide he doesn't want to ignite another crisis. So the White House will be under intense scrutiny once the next waiver is due, by June.
Human rights as a foreign policy priority
For successive administrations, the cause of human rights has been at the center of American foreign policy.
The issue does wax and wane in importance for different presidents. And there is often debate about whether a certain administration has de-emphasized human rights as a driver of relations with other countries. But human rights campaigners are especially worried about Trump.
He barely talked about the issue during his election campaign. And when he did, he provoked searching questions. In an interview with The New York Times in July, he declined to criticize Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for jailing thousands of political opponents and pointed out that the United States had its own share of problems.
"When the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don't think we're a very good messenger," Trump told the Times.
