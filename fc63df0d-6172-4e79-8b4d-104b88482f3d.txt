In late January, just two weeks after the Holy Pontiff's visited Chile, the Vatican announced the appointment of the archbishop of Malta, Monsignor Charles J. Scicluna, to clarify the most serious crimes committed within the Catholic Church.
In the beginning, it was reported that Monsignor Scicluna would review the testimony of the former seminarian Juan Carlos Cruz via Skype from a church in Philadelphia, in the United States, but the Bishop of Rome changed the instruction.
Now, the expert from the Vatican will travel to New York to meet with Cruz on February 17, as they agreed, it was officially announced. The Pope wants Scicluna to get Cruz's testimony first hand.
Cruz, one of the victims of sexual abuses by the ousted priest Fernando Karadima, sent a letter to the Holy Pontiff in 2015 in which he detailed the atrocities committed by the clergyman in conspiracy with the bishop of Osorno (southern Chile), Juan Barros.
The Bishop of Rome has shown signs of strength in his commitment to clarify the cases of pedophilia and sexual abuses committed by some ministers of the Catholic Church.
The Bishop of Malta is the prosecutor of the court of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, which is in charge of investigating the 'delicta graviora'; that is, the crimes against Eucharist that the Church considers most serious, including the secret of confession or sexual abuses committed by clergymen against minors.
