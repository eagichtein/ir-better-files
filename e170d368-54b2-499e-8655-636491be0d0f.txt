Those weapons would be linked with the radars and missiles carried aboard American Aegis warships in nearby waters.

A missile from Israel's Iron Dome defense system was launched to intercept incoming rocket fire from Gaza in November.
There is a similar effort in the Pacific centered on radars in Japan, Aegis warships at sea and land-based interceptors in Alaska and California.
The Obama administrationâs more recent focus has been the system to protect NATO allies in Europe with advanced radars based in Turkey and long-range interceptors to be based first in Romania and subsequently in Poland. American officials have emphasized that the limited number of interceptors in Europe are all about Iran, and would be inadequate to blunt Russiaâs vast nuclear arsenal; but the system remains an irritant in relations with Moscow.
During the conflict with Hamas, Israeli officials report that Iron Dome knocked down more than 400 rockets on flight paths to populated areas, with a kill rate of 85 percent. Hamas is said to have fired off more than 1,400 rockets in all, but Israel was able to limit Hamasâs ability to launch more of its arsenal of 12,000 rockets with pre-emptive attacks on the storehouses where they were kept.
But some antimissile experts have expressed doubt about Israeli claims for Iron Dome, which is built by Israeli defense firms but has received about $275 million in financial support from the United States. Bright flashes can create a visual impression of overwhelming interceptor success, when in fact they may represent nothing more than the interceptor warhead blowing up, these skeptics warn.
âIâve met the guys in Israel, and theyâre smart,â said Richard M. Lloyd, an antimissile expert with more than a dozen patents and two major textbooks on warhead design to his credit. âBut Iâm not seeing the things I want to seeâ to prove that Iron Dome actually succeeded to the extent described by Israel.
Mr. Lloyd, who works for Tesla Laboratories Inc., a defense contractor in Arlington, Va., said he had studied dozens of publicly available photographs of spent rockets that landed on Israel. Few of them, he said, showed signs of damage from Iron Domeâs exploding warhead and the specific mechanism by which the interceptor is designed to make its kill â a dense spray of speeding metal fragments.

Israelâs Iron Dome
In 2012, The Times reported on Israelâs Iron Dome, an antirocket interceptor system that is being deployed again to counter attacks by Hamas.

He acknowledged that some of the photographs may have been of enemy rockets that Iron Dome had not targeted because they were not headed toward populated areas. âIâm not saying the system is no good,â he stressed. âIâm saying I need more information.â

The president of Tesla Laboratories, George Stejic, echoed the doubts and said that the Israelis might have been tempted to exaggerate the degree of antimissile success as a calculated maneuver. âFrom a military perspective, the Israelis have every interest in overstating the efficacy of the system in order to deter missile launches,â he said. Israeli officials reject such skepticism, and stand by the statistics of Iron Domeâs success that they have released.
âThe numbers are very accurate,â said one Israeli official who discussed sensitive internal assessments of Iron Dome on the condition of anonymity. âMany of these video clips and pictures were taken by citizens, not professionals. You cannot learn very much from videos taken with an iPhone .â
