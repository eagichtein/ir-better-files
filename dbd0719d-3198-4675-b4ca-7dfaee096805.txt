The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, center, meeting in Pyongyang, the capital, on Monday, with South Korean envoys.

SEOUL, South Korea â North Koreaâs leader, Kim Jong-un, has told South Korean envoys he is willing to negotiate with the United States on abandoning his countryâs nuclear weapons, officials from the South said Tuesday. Mr. Kim also said he would suspend all nuclear and missile tests while such talks were underway, they said.
President Trump reacted with guarded optimism to the news, which potentially represented a major defusing of one of the worldâs tensest confrontations.
During the envoysâ two-day visit to Pyongyang , the Northâs capital, which ended on Tuesday, the two Koreas also agreed to hold a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea on the countriesâ border in late April, Mr. Moonâs office said in a statement.
âThe North Korean side clearly stated its willingness to denuclearize,â the statement said. âIt made it clear that it would have no reason to keep nuclear weapons if the military threat to the North was eliminated and its security guaranteed.â
If the statement is corroborated by North Korea, it would be the first time Mr. Kim has indicated that his government is willing to discuss relinquishing nuclear weapons in return for security guarantees from the United States. Until now, North Korea has said its nuclear weapons were not for bargaining away .
âThe North expressed its willingness to hold a heartfelt dialogue with the United States on the issues of denuclearization and normalizing relations with the United States,â the statement said. âIt made it clear that while dialogue is continuing, it will not attempt any strategic provocations, such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests.â
On Twitter, Mr. Trump, who has veered from bellicose threats against Mr. Kim to offers to sit down with him, welcomed what he called â possible progress â with the North. âFor the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned,â Mr. Trump said. âThe World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!â
Mr. Trump expounded on his reaction later to reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of Sweden. âWe have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,â Mr. Trump said. âThe statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.â
Asked if he would meet with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump said, âWeâll see what happens.â
The cautious American reaction partly reflected a history of suspicion toward the motives of North Korea, which has remained an enemy of the United States since the 1950-53 Korean War.
A pattern of what American officials have described as North Korean duplicity in previous talks has repeated itself, with modest variations, during the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. In January 2009, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who had served under both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, summarized the American skepticism about North Korea with an oft-repeated line: âIâm tired of buying the same horse twice.â
The South Korean statement said the two Koreas would begin working-level discussions to prepare for the summit meeting, to be held in the Peace House, a South Korean building in Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles the border. Before Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon meet, the countries will install, for the first time, a hotline by which the leaders can talk on the phone directly, the statement said.
The statement gave no indication that North Korea would start dismantling nuclear or missile programs anytime soon. Nonetheless, the reported agreements represented major progress in Mr. Moonâs efforts to improve relations with North Korea. Those efforts advanced considerably during the recent Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to which Mr. Kim sent athletes, entertainers and political delegations that included his sister .
The top South Korean envoys who returned from North Korea on Tuesday â Mr. Moonâs national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, and the director of the Southâs National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon â are expected to be dispatched to Washington this week to brief the Trump administration on their discussions with Mr. Kim.
Mr. Chung told reporters in Seoul, the South Korean capital, that Mr. Kim had been unexpectedly flexible. He said the delegation had expected him to insist that the South and the United States not hold their annual joint military exercises, which were suspended for the Olympics.
âKim Jong-un simply said he could understand why the joint exercises must resume in April on the same scale as before,â Mr. Chung said. âBut he said he expected them to be readjusted if the situation on the Korean Peninsula stabilizes in the future.â
Mr. Chung said the South Koreans believed that their agreements with North Korea would be enough to start a dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang. He also said he was carrying additional messages from Mr. Kim to the Trump administration that he could not reveal.
âThere was no other specific demand from North Korea in returning to dialogue,â he said. âThey only said they wanted to be treated like a serious dialogue partner.â
For Mr. Trump, the overture by North Korea sets in motion a challenging phase that will call on the United States to exercise diplomatic muscles after a long stretch in which the White House relied on economic pressure, backed by threats of military force, to deal with the North.
That challenge will be compounded because the State Departmentâs veteran North Korea negotiator, Joe Yun, recently announced his retirement from the Foreign Service. Another experienced negotiator, Victor Cha, was recently sidelined when the White House decided not to move ahead with his nomination as ambassador to South Korea.
Administration officials are deeply wary of being drawn into a negotiation in which the United States makes concessions â on issues like military exercises or shipments of medical and food aid â only to see the North Koreans renege on their commitments later.
Mr. Trump has said that the United States could talk with North Korea , but âonly under the right conditions.â American officials have repeatedly said they can start negotiations with the North only if it agrees to discuss denuclearizing. They have also insisted that the North first take some actions that would convince them of its sincerity.
Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera of Japan, which has steadfastly supported the Trump administrationâs tough approach to sanctions against North Korea, struck a note of caution about Pyongyangâs interest in negotiations.
âWhile talking about nuclear abandonment several times, it turned out that North Korea didnât halt its nuclear development in the past,â Mr. Onodera said. âWe need to carefully assess if this North and South dialogue will really lead to the abandonment of nuclear and missile development.â>>
