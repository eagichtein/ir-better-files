TRANSCRIPT +
(ROUGH CUT ONLY - NO REPORTER NARRATION)               U.S. President Barack Obama visited an Iron Dome rocket defense system in Israel on Wednesday (March 20).               Accompanied by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama toured the site on the first day of a three-day visit to the Middle East.               During his time in the region he will meet with both Israeli and Palestinian officials.                              Israel developed Iron Dome to shoot down rockets launched from the Gaza Strip and it is the only system in the world to use radar-guided missiles for such short-range interceptions.               Obama, whose visit will underscore his backing for the Israel's security, has earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars for Israeli defence programmes including Iron Dome.>>
