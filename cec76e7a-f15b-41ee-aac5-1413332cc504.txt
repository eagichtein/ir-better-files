Here's what happened at the historic Korea summit
The leaders of North Korea and South Korea met today for the first time in over a decade. Here are the highlights from the summit:
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in met at the line that separates the divided Koreas. Kim then stepped over the raised Military Demarcation Line, entering territory controlled by the South for the very first time. After posing for the cameras, Kim then grasped Moon's hand and they briefly crossed into the northern side:
The two leaders had meetings with officials, and then Kim and Moon took part in a symbolic tree-planting ceremony in the DMZ. The tree was from 1953, the year the Korean War armistice was signed.Â

Then, they signed the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula. The document commits the two countries to a nuclear-free peninsula and talks to bring a formal end to the Korean War .
The leaders ended the summit with a formal dinner â and a toast.

Leaders of the two Koreas haveÂ  agreed to end the Korean War â 65 years after hostilities ceased â in a wide-ranging joint announcement struck Friday,
The Koreas went to war in 1950 when soldiers from the North Korean People's Army invaded the South.
The armed conflict ended three years later in 1953, with the signing of an armistice agreement, but no formal peace treaty was ever signed, and technically, the Peninsula remains at war.

Kim and Moon say goodbye before leaving the DMZ
And that is that. Kim and Moon have left the demilitarized zone and the inter-Korean summit has officially come to a close.
Kim and his wife said their goodbyes to Moon and his wife before being driven in a car â flanked once again by Kimâs running bodyguards -- out of the Peace Village and presumably en route to Pyongyang.
Kim and Moon leave behind a feeling of promise and positivity that hasn't been felt on the Korean Peninsula for years. Along with a promise to finally end the war which has hung like a cloud over this part of the world for 65 years, the agreement they signed will see increased communication and cooperation going forward.
There will be much to debrief in the coming days and weeks for the two leaders and their allies, and now the focus will fall on US President Donald Trump's planned meeting with Kim -- it's been mooted for the end of May or beginning of June.

Friday's events in the demilitarized zone concluded with a suitably flashy performance. A Korean song called "One dream, One Korea" by South Korean singer Minah was performed by a pianist and accompanying orchestra while a huge projection was played onto the side of the Peace House.
