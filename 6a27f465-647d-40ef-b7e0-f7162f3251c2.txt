That is precisely the claim critics have challenged.
After the Gaza cease-fire last year, Mr. Lloyd began scrutinizing hundreds of online videos of Iron Dome in action. He was looking for unambiguous signs of success: pairs of fireballs (at night) or smoke clouds (during the day) that formed as speeding fragments blew up a warhead. He found very few, he said.
His method of video analysis won scientific backing long ago. During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the American military boasted that Patriot interceptors, built in the United States, had succeeded 96 percent of the time. But M.I.T. scientists analyzed broadcast videos and found only misses. Slowly, the Army retreated.
Mr. Lloyd also has the credentials for a critique, having written two books on antimissile warhead design during two decades at Raytheon, a top antimissile contractor. He now works for Tesla Laboratories, a defense contractor that has no projects competing with Iron Dome.
Mr. Lloyd says his doubts about Iron Dome deepened as he saw images of interceptors racing helter-skelter in the sky and found photographs of fallen rockets and even intact warheads.
From such evidence, as well as from rocket and warhead basics, Mr. Lloyd estimates that the system succeeded 30 percent to 40 percent of the time in detonating enemy warheads. For the remaining targets, he judges that the interceptor was either badly aligned or too far away, at best leaving the rockets wounded or thrown off course.
Mr. Lloyd and other critics acknowledge that, in some cases, deflections may indeed lessen damage on the ground, though they lack specific information.

In Israel, Mr. Lloyd won support from Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst and former fighter pilot long skeptical of his countryâs antimissile claims. Dr. Pedatzur found an Israeli police report saying that 109 rockets launched from Gaza â roughly twice the militaryâs figure â hit urban areas.
He also found evidence of wide destruction. A Finance Ministry report registered 3,165 claims of property damage, including to cars and buildings in cities like Ashdod and Beersheba, both protected by Iron Dome battalions.
Theodore A.Â Postol, a physicist at M.I.T. who helped reveal the Patriot antimissile failures of 1991, analyzed the new videos and found that Iron Dome repeatedly failed to hit its targets head-on. He concluded that the many dives, loops and curls of the interceptors resulted in diverse angles of attack that made it nearly impossible to destroy enemy warheads.
âItâs very hard to see how it could be more than 5 or 10 percent,â Dr. Postol said.
Mordechai Shefer, an Israeli rocket scientist formerly with Rafael, Iron Domeâs maker, studied nearly two dozen videos and, in a paper last month, concluded that the kill rate was zero.
American supporters of Iron Dome see the declarations of Israeli officials as credible, in part because the weaponâs targets are relatively slow, small and unsophisticated. âThey have no guidance system,â noted Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance , a private group in Alexandria, Va. âTheyâre not as accurate as missiles, so Israel doesnât have to hit them all.â
The senior Israeli official who defended Iron Dome said he understood the skepticism because the worldâs first antimissile war â which erupted over Israel in 1991 during the gulf war â did produce exaggerated claims of success. But he rejected the idea that Iron Dome was missing or deflecting most of its targets. The images of online videos, he suggested, lacked the sharpness to reliably see kills within the glowing fireballs.
Enemy warheads, the official stressed, were âdestroyed â not engaged â destroyed.â But as the interview unfolded, he offered examples of partial rocket destruction that seemed to contradict the portrayals of total annihilation. Falling debris, he conceded, could sometimes destroy a car or damage a house. But he dismissed reports of wide damage on the ground as rumors.
The Obama administration has cited the videos as testimonials to the systemâs importance. âEverybody gets it,â Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recently told the annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, prompting thousands to break into applause. âEverybody saw.â
